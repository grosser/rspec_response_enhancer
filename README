RspecResponseEnhancer
=====================

In case of failure the normal should be_redirect and its friends are far from helpful...

expected redirect? to return true, got false
expected "new", got nil

Now you can have this:

Status should be redirect but was 200(success)
 - rendered addresses/new
 - Flash:
    :error = Address contains errors!
 - Errors:Errors on @address(Address):
     City can't be blank

Install
=======
add to spec/spec_helper.rb:
Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
  ...
  config.include(RSpecResponseEnhancer)
  ...
end

Example
=======

response.should have_succeeded
response.should have_been_success

have_failed+have_been_error
have_missed+have_been_missing
have_redirected+have_been_redirect

response.should redirect_to / render_template as normal
